Sure, here is the code for a website about myself:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>About Bard</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
    <h1>About Bard</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
    <section>
        <h2>Who is Bard?</h2>
        <p>Bard is a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>How can I use Bard?</h2>
        <p>You can use Bard to learn new things, get creative, or simply have a conversation. I am always learning and growing, so I am always up for a new challenge.</p>
    </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
    <p>Copyright &copy; 2023 Bard</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
Here is the CSS:
```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

header {
  background-color: #000;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
}

main {
  margin-top: 20px;
}

section {
  padding: 20px;
}

h1, h2 {
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: bold;
}

p {
  font-size: 1em;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

footer {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

This is just a basic example, and you can customize it to fit your own needs and preferences. For example, you could add more styles to the website, or add additional features.
